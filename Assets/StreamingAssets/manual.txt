welcome the to manual. let me explain the .blocklist format to you. it goes like this:

{blockname} idx(this declares the index) {indexnumber} tex(this declares the texture name) {texname} plc(this declares the sound for placing a block!) {audioname (file extention not included)} des(this declares the sound for destroying a block!) {audioname (file extention not included)}

make sure to format it correctly. every parameter is separated by a space. so dont add anything extra!

index is what position it will appear in in the list of blocks. the block index of 0 will be the default.

textures are stored in StreamingAssets/tex! make sure your file format is .png!

audio is stored in StreamingAssets/sfx! make sure your file format is .ogg!

here is an explanation of the .uvbmap files.

the format goes like this: {blockindex},{x position},{y position},{z position}
