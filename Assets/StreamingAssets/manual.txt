hi! welcome to the manual. this is a simple tutorial on how to mod the game. lets start with nodelists!

|||

    nodelists are simple. here is how they work:

    node: declares a node that the game finds by name.

    anything inside this node is data the game can use.

    end tells the reader when to move onto the next node.

    the blocklist node stores all the block data. it works as follows:

    every space separates the data. so dont change the format at all! (this is subject to change for easier writing and reading)

    idx declares the block's index.

    tex declares the block's tex name (located in the tex folder. keep in mind the format has to be .png)

    plc declares the block's place sound name (located in the sfx folder. keep in mind the format has to be .ogg)

    des declares the block's destroy sound name

    the menu and ingame music nodes are very easy to understand.
    
    inside each node is a list of music file names. the game will play these at random. (keep in mind the format has to be .ogg)

---

lets move onto .uvbmap files. it is not recommended to edit these manually.

    uvbmaps are simple. the format is as follows:

    {blockindex},{x position},{y position},{z position}
