welcome the to manual. let me explain the .blocklist format to you. it goes like this:

{blockname} idx(this declares the index) {indexnumber} tex(this declares the texture name) {texname} snd(this declares the sound type) {soundtype}

make sure to format it correctly. every parameter is separated by a space. so dont add anything extra!

index is what position it will appear in, in the list of blocks. the first index of block will be the default.

textures are stored in StreamingAssets/tex! make sure your file format is .png!

sounds are not customizable without source code.. yet.. as of now there are 4 sound templates. if you want you can always use the source code to add more!
